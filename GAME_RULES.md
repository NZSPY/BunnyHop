## Gameplay

### Turn Structure
On your turn, you must:
1. Play one card from your hand (if possible)
2. Draw one card from the draw pile

### Card Types

#### Hop Cards (1-10)
- Play a Hop card to move your bunny forward by that number
- You can only play a Hop card that matches the color of the top discard card OR is any value

#### Action Cards
- **Skip**: Next player loses their turn
- **Reverse**: Reverse the direction of play
- **Block**: Place on another player to prevent them from playing Hop cards on their next turn
- **Double**: Your next Hop card counts for double value

#### Special Cards
- **Wild Hop**: Acts as any color and any value 1-10
- **Wild Action**: Acts as any action card
- **Draw Two**: Next player draws 2 cards and skips their turn
- **Finish Line**: Instantly win if you're at position 15 or higher

### Winning
The first player to reach position 20 or play a Finish Line card (when at position 15+) wins the game.

## Strategy Tips
- Save your high-value Hop cards for when you're close to winning
- Use Action cards to slow down opponents who are ahead
- Wild cards are valuable - use them wisely
- Watch the discard pile color to plan your next moves
